#+TITLE: Patches
# LocalWords: tmux

This directory contains several patches for extending or fixing existing programs.
These patches are intended to be applied to the target programs source code prior
to compilation and they each fix one or more issues I may have with the program.

For example:

#+begin_src shell
  patch -p0 < "$DOTFILES/setup/patch/tmux-fix-extended-key-swallowing.diff"
#+end_src
