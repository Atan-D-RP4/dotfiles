* Dotfiles
  My dotfile repository, happily brought to you by [[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot][dotbot]] :book:.

** Requirements
   - python >= 3.7

** Installation Instructions
   ~git clone /uri/of/this/repo ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install~ will install
   a basic dotfile configuration for you.

   However you'll more likely want to setup a bunch of different things, and to that end
   you can do so by passing the ~DOTBOTS~ environment variable to install. ~DOTBOTS~
   should be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values][CSV]] list of features you want installed, for a list of available features
   you can run:

   #+NAME: config-options
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results value list :exports code
   ./setup/list-opts
   #+END_SRC

   WARN: to run the above command, you must have loaded any required submodules.
         you can do so non-destructively by running src_sh[:exports code]{./install --help}.

   I recommend using the dotbots specified by ~./setup/suggested -awe --nvim~. I.E.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results value :exports code
   DOTBOTS=$(./setup/suggested -awe --nvim | tr '\n' ',') ./install
   #+END_SRC
