# rg - ripgrep

[ripgrep][rg] is a better grep. Written in rust with direct support for PCRE and a
plethora of cool extra features. I use rg mostly as a find/fd alternative because:
1. It lets you. There's a flag which just outputs the paths to be searched.
2. It supports ignore configurations (eg. *.gitignore*) which makes it perfect for
   listing files in my dotfiles repository.

Normally I wouldn't go as far as create a subfolder configuration for a general
purpose utility like rg but seeing as rg supports a config file and I'd like to
change some of the default options, this seemed like a good idea.
