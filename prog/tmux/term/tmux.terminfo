# -*- mode: conf -*- Terminfo declaration for tmux which just alias screen.
#
# See the [[https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/2.1/FAQ#L355-L383][FAQ]], turns out tmux hard-codes in some behaviour to maintain
# compatibility with screen but that invalidates some xterm like extensions
# such as italics or strikethrough.
#
# The behaviour is only present when your tmux terminal is set to screen* so
# this is just an alternate terminal definition which is identical to the
# screen variants but due to having a different name doesn't fall prey to this
# annoyance ðŸ˜‚.
