# Terminfo
This directory contains the files/configurations needed to enable true-color support
in tmux and any terminal programs which may rely on it (eg. emacs).

Much of the content here-in was adapted from [this][reddit] comment using assistance
from [here][tmux-24] and [here][vim24]. You can also find an alternative guide in
[here][spacemacs/term].

## Method
First double check your current client has true-color support by running `tmux info |
grep Tc`. If not check the `terminal-overrides` option and make sure its setup to
enable the **Tc** option on your current terminal. More information can be found in
[[man:tmux][tmux]].

Now run `tic -x screen-24bit.terminfo` to compile and install the terminal-capabilities/info
for your true-color terminal.

That should be all. Double check when you start a terminal that your TERM value is `screen-24bit`.
Then open any programs you use like you normally would and they should detect and adapt to the
enhanced capabilities :-).
