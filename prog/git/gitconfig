	# You pull, edit, commit, rebase, merge etc. code just like you would normally but
	# to submit patches upstream you have to email them as a set of patch-series through
	# the [[man:git-send-email][git send-email]] command. This will send an initial message for the first patch
	# (or a cover-letter) and then send the remaining messages as replies to that initial
	# message. Developers on the mailing list will respond to each patch individually and
	# when ready rebase the patch series onto the repository.
	#
	# When creating a follow up set of patches you should export the patch-set with the
	# reroll-count argument to increment the patch:
	#   git format-patch --reroll-count=2 HEAD -- outputfile.patch
	# You should then find the email chain tracking your pull request and select the raw
	# Message-ID field and supply this as the --in-reply-to argument to git-send-email to
	# continue the message chain. For example:
	#   git send-email --to 62994@debbugs.gnu.org -v2 --in-reply-to='<handler.62994.B.168208734930664.ack@debbugs.gnu.org>' *.patch
