#+Title: RClone

RClone is a file sync tool for interfacing with remote storage providers like Google
Drive or Dropbox. It lets you mount these provider services through the FUSE file
system so you can access your files transparently. After installation you'll need to
configure the specific rclone backends you want to use (see [[https://rclone.org/docs/][here]]).

* Automount on Login
  You can use systemd to automatically mount a rclone account when you login. There's
  a rclone-mount-service utility package this module will install. To enable it you
  can run =systemctl --user enable --now rclone@GoogleDrive.service=. After this I'd
  also recommend adding a unit override to mount to a custom location:

  #+begin_src conf
    [Unit]
    AssertPathIsDirectory=
    AssertPathIsDirectory="%h/External/%I"

    [Service]
    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/rclone mount "%I:" "%h/External/%I"
    ExecStop=
    ExecStop=/bin/fusermount -u "%h/External/%I"
  #+end_src
