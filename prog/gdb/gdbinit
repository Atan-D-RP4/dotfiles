# GNU GDB Initialisation File -- -*- mode: conf-space; +indent: 2 -*- vim:syntax=conf:filetype=conf
#
# This GDB configuration file is a partly derived from [[https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit][mammon]] gdbinit, from revision
# 8.0.5 (18/08/2013). Much of it has been split up into sub configurations in the
# [[file:conf.d/][conf.d]] directory.

# GDB does not support the informative source mechanism used by programs like bash.
# My actual GDB configuration has been split up into a series of files that are all
# assumed to be in a conf.d subdirectory of the same directory as this file. Because
# GDB cannot tell me the path to this file, we pass it through as the GDBINIT
# environment variable.
