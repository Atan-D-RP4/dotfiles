# VIM/NeoVIM Configuration

This is where I keep my shared vim/nvim config.

Ideally I'd like to dump vimscript in a dumpster and move entirely to a
lua based neovim config, but given how frequently I jump between machines
I can't guarantee I'll always have nvim installed. I will always have vim
installed however, so I've opted to avoid lua until upstream vim decides
to switch to a sensible configuration language like lua.
