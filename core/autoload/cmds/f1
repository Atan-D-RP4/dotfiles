# A wrapper around find which lets you specify a few default options.
#
# Find is a cool program, but its syntax is really restrictive. You can
# only specify paths to be searched at the start of the command. So if
# you ever want to make an alias with some default options, eg:
#   find -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1
# You lose the ability to supply paths to be searched, you can only append
# more conditions to the query.
#
# f1 gets around these issues by partitioning the passed arguments into
# paths and flags (depending on the first character of the arg). Any default
# flags are passed through the FIND_ARGS environment variable meaning now you
# get the best of both worlds.

f1() {
  local FIND_ARGS="${FIND_ARGS:- -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1}"
  paths=( )
  while [ "$#" -gt 0 ]; do
    if [[ "$1" =~ -.* ]]; then
      break
    fi

    paths+=( "$1" )
    shift
  done
  [ "${#paths[@]}" -eq 0 ] && paths+=( . )
  find "${paths[@]}" $FIND_ARGS "$@"
}
