# Autoloads
This is where you put autoloaded commands, shortcuts and other alias configurations.
Distribution and shell specific autoloads can be found in the current-working-directory
Autoloaded commands are in the [commands](./cmds) directory. For shells that don't support
autoloads (eg. bash), every file in the *commands* directory will be sourced instead.
