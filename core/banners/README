# banners
Inspired by [[https://gitlab.com/dwt1/shell-color-scripts][shell-color-scripts]], this directory lists a bunch of colorful banners
that you can show at the start of your shell. Personally I don't like the idea of
installing an external program (or adding a submodule) to my core dotfile
configuration, furthermore I also didn't see the need for these to be implemented as
scripts. Simple text files which contain color codes (while not human readable) are
much better than trying to get the same affect with shell substitutions. Therefore
the format of banners in this directory has the first line containing the width and
height of the banner (: delimited) and the rest of the file containing the banner itself.

shell-color-scripts uses the [[https://gitlab.com/dwt1/shell-color-scripts/-/blob/6c43c647027cb6e980a0eede72bd9d8f80bf59a1/LICENSE][MIT]] license so assume all the banners in this directory
do the same :P.
